ANNOUNCEMENT
============

Unfortunately my computer has died and due to a lack of continous employment over the recent months I am currently unable to purchase a replacement machine at this point.

I will therefore no longer be developing this software until I am able to purchase a replacement.

It is always a little rude to ask for donations, but as I am developing this software free of charge for everyone to use. I will therefore be accepting donations towards the purchase of a new machine.

What does it actually do?
Not an awful lot. It's a joke.

I laughed. Can I tip you?
