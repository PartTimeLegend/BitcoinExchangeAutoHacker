{"name":"Bitcoin Exchange Auto Hacker","tagline":"","body":"ANNOUNCEMENT\r\n============\r\n\r\nUnfortunately my computer has died and due to a lack of continous employment over the recent months I am currently unable to purchase a replacement machine at this point.\r\n\r\nI will therefore no longer be developing this software until I am able to purchase a replacement.\r\n\r\nIt is always a little rude to ask for donations, but as I am developing this software free of charge for everyone to use. I will therefore be accepting donations towards the purchase of a new machine.\r\n\r\nBTC: [1CdzakhzxS5QMfe9bM6KZapNWbFtfNKimx](bitcoin:1CdzakhzxS5QMfe9bM6KZapNWbFtfNKimx) | TRC: [1HgyXPsAhyD6wCGqp5Ntgq8549XkWTauvG](terracoin:1HgyXPsAhyD6wCGqp5Ntgq8549XkWTauvG) | LTC: [LRqjHkL5wFt9JxE5vmHGcxNCbqQMvyEJY5](litecoin:LRqjHkL5wFt9JxE5vmHGcxNCbqQMvyEJY5)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInspired by this post on Reddit.\r\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/19r365/45/c8qoiuj\r\n\r\nWhat does it actually do?\r\nNot an awful lot.
